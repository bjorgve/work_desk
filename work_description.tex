The student is to work on developing the Very Accurate Multiresolution
Python Routines (VAMPyR). VAMPyR is a high level python interface to
the MRCPP code, developed at the chemistry department at UiT.

Pybind11 is used to expose the C++ routines from mrcpp into python.
The student is to expand the capabilities of vampyr. This can be
done by selecting one or several of these independent tasks:

1. Make the code structure in VAMPyR, mirror the code structure
   in MRCPP.

2. Import functionallity from the MRCHEM code similar to how it is
   done with MRCPP.

3. Solve partial differential equations or chemistry problems using VAMPYR,
   and Jupyter Notebooks that can be used as code examples in the
   documentation, in addition to being used as tests of the code.
   This could also include code examples that can be used in
   teaching.

4. Publish the code on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

To deal with these challanges it's required that the student
has some experience with Python or C/C++. Familiarity with
git, cmake, jupyter notebooks or Green's functions is an advantage but not
an requirement.
